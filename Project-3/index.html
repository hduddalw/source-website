        Work after coming to grad school became introspective, nudging me to look inward. As a result, responses to briefs came in intuitively, allowing me to create, without a lot of inquiry, necessarily; and the output turned towards abstraction.</p>

        <p>Use of shapes and forms, images, and words became a crucial component of my work — all adding together to build a narrative, visually.</p>

        <p>I perceive forms and read the shapes that make them in a similar way. For instance, I strongly relate with a <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-01.svg"> circle. More when it’s black. Now if a square cuts through it, I sense absence and if it gets bigger and overlaps it, I sense constraints. When the circle wraps itself in these <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-02.svg"> spikes, there’s a sense of excitement and when the spikes grow and get sharper, I sense fear.</p>

        <p>I see these forms combining with other forms birthing <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-03.svg"> complex structures, forms that are more expressive as if they were humans — entities with mixed but similar <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-03.svg"> emotions and yet each one of them, distinct in their own ways.</p>

        <p>When these structures live in a space, amongst other structures, <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-04.svg"> forming a composition of some sorts, they start to tell a story. The relation these forms share with each other is fascinating to me. And as <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-05.svg"> much as I enjoy making (and defining) these forms for myself, <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-06.svg"> I am curious to know how someone else resonates and interacts with them, [stamps] i.e. how the same form speaks differently to different people. I am aware of the subjectivity this holds — maybe you relate with <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-07.svg"> it differently, maybe it means something to you, or maybe nothing. This is where human instincts come into play and to explore this, I want to break out of <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-08.svg"> being the sole agent of my design, opening up this system to others to play and experiment, nudging them to make their own compositions, to <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-09.svg"> tell their stories.</p>

        <p>I want to <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-10.svg"> continue exploring the energy and feeling that can be <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-11.svg"> created through <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-12.svg"> simple forms, <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-13.svg"> color, <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-14.svg"> repetition/pattern, and words. Seeing what you can do and the stories <img src="/assets/svg/SVG_Source-15.svg"> you can tell with just a little.</p>
